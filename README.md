## Introduction

WhatsApp has over 1.2 billion daily active users today. WhatsApp has become an indispensible part of our lives. The app has made it fast and easier to stay connected with our friends.
However, it can be little annoying at times when the chat app automatically download all those stupid memes, audio files, videos and photos. This not just makes the phone's gallery look like a complete mess, it also eats up you mobile data. Here is a fix to this to this problem.
Too many WhatsApp images, videos making your phone slow down. Deleting whole WhasApp Images folder is bad option because it may contain our important personal images.
So we need to somehow seperate out unnecessary memes picture and our personal images.

**Can we build a model which can identify memes images and real images**?


Google's File app is there to help you out it is finding memes images and listed those images to user, then user will decide whichone he/she want to keep in phone and whichone he/she would like to delete.
Memes detection app is similar small demo version app.
